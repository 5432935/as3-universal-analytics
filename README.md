=======================

Google Universal Analytics for ActionScript 3.0  
(**Flash** / **AIR** / **Redtamarin**).

For few years people could use [gaforflash](https://code.google.com/p/gaforflash/)
to [track Flash content with Google Analytics](http://analytics.blogspot.fr/2008/11/want-to-track-adobe-flash-now-you-can.html),
the solution was not perfect but it did work for the general use cases.

Now, with [the evolution of Google Analytics to Universal Analytics](http://analytics.blogspot.fr/2014/04/universal-analytics-out-of-beta-into.html),  
we can offer the Flash Platform a new library which can cover more specific and advanced use cases.

Simply put, **as3-universal-analytics** is an ActionScript 3 implementation
of the [Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/).
